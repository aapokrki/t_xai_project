This repository contains the code for our method experiments. We implemented all our XAI methods in google colab. Thus, we provide the code but also links that open the 
Jupyter Notebooks in colab such that they are directly executable. Thus, we recommend opening the links to colab 
and reviewing our code there. 

- Link to the pretrained model demo. This notebook showcases how to load the model and evaluate it on the Cifar10 test split and provides the class-wise accuracies for all 10 classes. <br>
